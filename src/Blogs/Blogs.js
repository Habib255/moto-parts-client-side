                    </span></h2>
                    <p><span className='font-bold text-slate-200'>Answer: </span> There are four main types of state you need to properly manage in your React apps:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Local state- Normally we use useState to manage date.useReducer also use here.</li>
                        <li> Global state -useState and  useReducer are normally use for it . it's little bit tricky to use by lifting state up and down by props </li>
                        <li> Server site state - useState and useEffect are use for fetching server site date.</li>
                        <li> URL state - useHistory and useLocation are use to manage url state.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 className="card-title font-bold text-slate-200"> Question: Why you do not set the state directly in React. For example, if you have const[products, setProducts] = useState([]). Why you do not <br /> set products = [...] instead,  you use the setProducts</h2>
                    <p><span className='font-bold text-slate-200'>Answer: </span> If we declare product = [...] that means we assigned a const value. <br /> And when we need to set the value again we cant assing. it's tough to access value of product. But When We use setState/ setProduct <br /> it's normally assigned the value of product where needed.
                        We can set the value according to the state using set state. </p>
